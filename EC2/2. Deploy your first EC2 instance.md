         *  Enable termination protection    `As per it's name`
         *  Monitoring     `By default cloudwatch monitors your instance at every 5 mins. However, if you check it, it'll start monitoring your instance at every 1 min & additional charges will be applied for that.`
         *  Tenancy     `How you want to run your instance? For ex, as a dedicated instance, on a dedicated host or in shared hardware manner.`

         *  Here you insert rules such as, which protocol should be allowed on which port for which IP or Range of IPs?
