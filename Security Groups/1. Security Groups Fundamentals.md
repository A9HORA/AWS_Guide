1.  Acts as a host-based, statuful firewall. For ex, a windows firewall.
2.  You can manage the traffic the instance is receiving or sending from here, by `inbound` and `outbound` rules.
3.  Security groups are stateful so if you create an inbound rule for a HTTP request it'll automatically allow an outbound rule for it as well.
4.  In terms of security groups, there is no way of blacklist IP/s or Port/s. However, everything is block by default unless you allow something.
5.  You can create/edit/delete the security group as per your need. To do so please follow below mentioned steps.
    * Goto EC2 > Network & Security > Security Groups
    * Create Security Group
        1.  Security group name   `As per it's name`
        2.  Description   `As per it's name`
        3.  VPC   `Choose VPC where you want to apply this security group`
        4.  Inbound rules   `Set some inbound rules here`
        5.  Outbound rules    `Set some outbound rules here`
        6.  Create security group
6.  For one EC2 instance there could be multiple security groups and for one security groups there could be multiple EC2 instances as well. So you can create multiple security groups and apply them later as per your need. To do so:
    * Goto EC2 > Select Instance > Networking > Change security groups > Associated security groups > Select security groups > Add security group > Save
