# AWS_Guide  
This repo is basically a collection of notes I made during my aws study so anyone who wants to start with AWS can utilize it.

# Note  
1.  Please create your AWS account first. So you can make your hands dirty with handson.
2.  Amazon updates the AWS console's design and adds certain features in periodic manner. There are possibilities of certain changes while you use this repo. Therefore, I would recommend to refer AWS documentation if you are stuck somewhere.
