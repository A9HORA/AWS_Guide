* The AWS WAF(Web application firewall) lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to AWS Cloudfront, an application load balancer or API Gateway. Moreover, lets you control access to your content.  
* As it's WAF, it'll be layer-7 aware firewall which is Application Layer of OSI model.  
* We can monitor query string parameters and actual information you are receiving at the server's using WAF.  
* You can also configure conditions such as IP address whitelisting or blacklisting to make certain request to be allowed. Based on that the application load balancer or cloudfront or API gateway will accept the request or allow the content or respond with 403 response code.  
* There are three different types of behaviour allowed by the WAF as following:  
  1.  Allow all the requests except the ones you specified.  
  2.  Block all the requests except the ones you specified.  
  3.  Count the requests that matches the properties you specified.  
* We can define conditions by using characteristics of web requests such as:  
  1.  IP address that requests originate from.  
  2.  Country that requests originate from.  
  3.  Values in request headers.  
  4.  String that appears in request, could be specific ones or based on regex.  
  5.  Length of request.  
  6.  Presence of malicious SQL code.  
  7.  Presence of malicious script.
