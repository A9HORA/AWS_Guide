  * Configure health check
    * Name `Name of your choice`
    * What to monitor?

      * Status of other health checks  
      * State of CloudWatch alarm  
  * Monitor an endpoint `Thise will get changed if you choose different one form above ones.`
    * Specify endpoint by
      * IP address
      * Domain name
    * Protocol
      * HTTP
      * HTTPS
      * TCP
    * IP addresss
    * Hostname `Here mention your domain name`
    * Port  
    * Path `Location to the endpoint`
 
 2. Get notified when health check fails
