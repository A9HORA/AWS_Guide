# Note
* Here we are using EC2 and Route53.  
* NS and SOA records will be present by default.  
* For latency based routing you can use VPN for results.  
## Simple Routing Policy
* One record with multiple IPs.
  1.  Note down the IPs of the EC2 instances you wish to use.
  2.  Goto Services > Route53 > Hosted Zones > Create Record 
  3.  Select Simple routing
  4.  Configure records > Define simple record
      * Record name `If you want to allow traffic to main domain then leave it empty if not then mention subdomain name.`  
      * Value/Route traffic to `I chose IP address or another value, depending on the record type for my LAB`
      * Define simple record
      * TTL `For clearing IP from DNS cache.`  
  5.  Create records  
## Weighted Routing Policy  
* Splits the traffic based on assigned weights.
* You have to repeat from step 4 to 5 because you want to distribute the weight.  
  1.  Note down the IPs of the EC2 instances you wish to use.
  2.  Goto Services > Route53 > Hosted Zones > Create Record 
  3.  Select Weighted Routing Policy
  4.  Configure records
      * Basic configuration
          * Record name `If you want to allow traffic to main domain then leave it empty if not then mention subdomain name.`  
          * Record type `Choose your record type`  
          * TTL    
      * Weighted records to add to **your_domain**  
          * Define weighted record
          * Value/Route traffic to `Same as above `
          * Mention IP/s to distribute weight.
  5.  Create records  
## Latency Routing Policy  
* Allows you to route your traffic based on the network latency for your end user. `Which region will give them the fastest response.`  
* For using latency based routing, you need to create a latency resource record set for the EC2 or ELB resource in each region that hosts your website.  
* When a user queries for your website Route53 selects the latency resource record set for the region that gives the user the lowest latency and the responds with the value associated with that resource record set.  
* You need to create individual A record based on the region you are using for your website.  
  1.  Note down the IPs of the EC2 instances you wish to use.
  2.  Goto Services > Route53 > Hosted Zones > Create Record 
  3.  Select Latency Routing Policy
  4.  Configure records
      * Basic configuration
          * Same as above  
      * Latency record to add to **your_domain**
          * Value/Route traffic to `Same as above `  
          * Region  
          * Health Check  
          * Record ID  
  5.  Create records      
## Failover Routing Policy
* Useful for creating active/passive setup. Such you want your one site to be in X zone while the other one in Y zone. Here Route53 will monitor the primary site using health check.  
* You have to repeat below steps for setting up the secondary failover record type.  
  1.  Note down the IPs of the EC2 instances you wish to use.
  2.  Goto Services > Route53 > Hosted Zones > Create Record 
  3.  Select Failover Routing Policy
  4.  Configure records  
      * Basic configuration
          * Same as above  
      * Define failover record  
          * Value/Route traffic to `Same as above `  
          * Failover record type  
          * Health Check  
          * Record ID  
  5.  Create records

## Geolocation Routing Policy  
* Let's you choose where your traffic should be sent based on the geolocation of your users.
* All the configurations are same as **Latency Routing Policy**

## Geoproximity Routing (Traffic Flow) (You can skip this as this is what used by network engineers)  
* Route traffic to your resources based on the geolocation of your users and your resources.  
* You can also optionally choose to route more or less traffic to a given resource by specifying a value called **bias**.  
* A bias expands or shrinks the size of the geographical region based on the traffic is routed on a resource.  
* **To use this routing it's required to use traffic flow.**
* So we will create a traffic policy first as follows:
  1.  Note down the IPs of the EC2 instances you wish to use.
  2.  Goto Services > Route53 > Traffic policies  
  3.  Create Traffic policy
      * Name policy
        * Policy name
        * Version description  
      * Create traffic policy  
        * Start point  
          * DNS type `Choose your DNS type`  
        * Connect to  
          * Geoproximity rule  
          * Endpoint location `Choose region of your instances`  
          * Bias `Set bias value`  
          * Health checks
        * Create Traffic Policy
          
## Multivalue Answer Policy  
* This is similar to simple routing however it allows you to put health checks on each record set, so Route53 returns only values for healthy resources.  
* This policy lets you configure Route53 to return multi value such as IPs for your web server, in response to DNS queries for any record.
* **Steps for applying this policy is same as Simple Routing Policy.**
