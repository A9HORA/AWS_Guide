# Note
* Here we are using EC2 and Route53.  
* NS and SOA records will be present by default.  
* For latency based routing you can use VPN for results.  
## Simple Routing Policy
* One record with multiple IPs.
  1.  Note down the IPs of the EC2 instances you wish to use.
  2.  Goto Services > Route53 > Hosted Zones > Create Record 
  3.  Select Simple routing
  4.  Configure records > Define simple record
      * Record name `If you want to allow traffic to main domain then leave it empty if not then mention subdomain name.`  
      * Value/Route traffic to `I chose IP address or another value, depending on the record type for my LAB`
      * Define simple record
      * TTL `For clearing IP from DNS cache.`  
  5.  Create records  
## Weighted Routing Policy  
* Splits the traffic based on assigned weights.
* You have to repeat from step 4 to 5 because you want to distribute the weight.  
  1.  Note down the IPs of the EC2 instances you wish to use.
  2.  Goto Services > Route53 > Hosted Zones > Create Record 
  3.  Select Weighted Routing Policy
  4.  Configure records
      * Basic configuration
          * Record name `If you want to allow traffic to main domain then leave it empty if not then mention subdomain name.`  
          * Record type `Choose your record type`  
          * TTL    
      * Weighted records to add to **your_domain**  
          * Define weighted record
          * Value/Route traffic to `Same as above `
          * Mention IP/s to distribute weight.
  5.  Create records  
## Latency Routing Policy  
* Allows you to route your traffic based on the network latency for your end user. `Which region will give them the fastest response.`  
* For using latency based routing, you need to create a latency resource record set for the EC2 or ELB resource in each region that hosts your website.  
* When a user queries for your website Route53 selects the latency resource record set for the region that gives the user the lowest latency and the responds with the value associated with that resource record set.  
* You need to create individual A record based on the region you are using for your website.  
  1.  Note down the IPs of the EC2 instances you wish to use.
  2.  Goto Services > Route53 > Hosted Zones > Create Record 
  3.  Select Latency Routing Policy
  4.  Configure records
      * Basic configuration
          * Same as above  
      * Latency record to add to **your_domain**
          * Value/Route traffic to `Same as above `  
          * Region  
          * Health Check  
          * Record ID  
  5.  Create records
