# This is about the networking and network interfaces in AWS.  
1. Here, we will focus on below mentioned ones:  
    1. ENI (Elastic Network Interface)  
        *   A virtual network card  
        *   Provides private one or more IPv4/s from your VPC IPv4 range and one public IPv4.
        *   Also provides one or more IPv6 addresses.
        *   A MAC address.
        *   A source & destination check flag.
        *   In other words, it functions as a NIC we attach in our PC.
        *   You can use multiple ENIs as per your need.
        *   Use cases,
            *   For Management Network
            *   For network & secuity appliances in VPC
            *   For creating dual-homed instances with workloads/roles on distinct subnets.
            *   As a low-cost HA solution.
    2. EN (Enhanced Networking)  
        *   Uses **single root I/O virtualization(SR-IOV)** to provide high-performance networking capabilities on **supported instance types**.  
        *   Useful for more intense workload which ENI unable to handle.  
        *   It's method which provides high-performance with low cpu usage. In other words, it speeds up your network. Therefore there will be:  
             *   higher bandwidth  
             *   higher PPS(Packets Per Second) performance  
             *   consistently lower inter-instance latencies  
             *   All of these are **Free Free Free**  
    3. EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter)  
        *   A networking device that you can attach to you instance to accelerate HPC(High Performance Computing) and machine learning applications.
