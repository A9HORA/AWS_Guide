## Note
1.  You can encrypt the root volume right from the start when you are deploting the instance for the first time at **Add Storage step**.
2.  This is for already deployed instances.

## Steps
1.  Create a snapshot first as mentioned [here](https://github.com/A9HORA/AWS_Guide/tree/master/Elastic%20Block%20Store(EBS)).
2.  Goto EC2 > Snapshots > Choose the snapshot > Actions > Copy 
    * Change the description as per your convenience.  
    * Click on Encryption Checkbox.  
    * Copy
3.  You can now create an AMI from this encrypted snapshot and deploy instances with the encrypted root volumes.
