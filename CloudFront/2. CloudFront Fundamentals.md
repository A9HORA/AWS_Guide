# CloudFront is discontinuing support for RTMP distributions on December 31, 2020.

1. It's a CDN **(Content Delivery Network)**, a system of distributed system or network that deliveres the web-content to a user based on 
    1. the geographical locations of the user, 
    2. the origin of the web-page,
    3. a content delivery server.
2. The cloudfront is useful to deliver the entire website, including dynamic, static, streaming and interactive content using a global network of edge locations. The request you 
   made for the content will be automatically routed to the nearest edge location so the content will be delivered with the best possible performance.
3. The edge locations we are talking about are not just READ-Only. You can put your object on them (WRITE).
4. The objects will be cached for the life of the **TTL(Time To Live)**
5. You will be charged by AWS for clearing cached ojects. `Clearing cache objects also known as object invalidation.`
6. CloudFront is global service not a region specific.
7. You can use cloudfront for web-site and for media streaming as well. This is known as distribution types: `1. Web Distribution` and `2. RTMP`
