## Why?
* There are two different ways for accessing the ec2 instance as per [this](https://github.com/A9HORA/AWS_Guide/blob/master/IAM/2.%20Create%20Individual%20IAM%20users%20and%20Password%20policy.md).  
* For programmatic access, generally AWS console becomes handy tool for performing different aws operations via console and for that you get a secret key for the configuration.
* The issue is the secret key gets stored locally which raises security issues. Once you get hack the attacker will be able to have that key and use it for the other instances as well.
* To avoid this we can setup specific role for specific instance a follows.

## Steps
1.  Select Instance  
2.  Goto Actions > Instance settings > Modify IAM role
    From *Choose IAM role* select any role as per your need.`Please read the description present with the role name while you chose one.`
    Save.
