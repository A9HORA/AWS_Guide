* VPC stands for `Virtual Private Cloud`. Preety much anything within a data center you can consider.
* You can have complete control over your virtual environment such as,  
  * Selection of your own IP range.
  * Creation of subnets.
  * Configuration of the routing table and network gateway.
  * Storage.
  * Database.
* Anything which is applicable in a data-center.  
* You can create a VPN as well providing connection between your datacenter and your VPC.  
* Below diagram can help us to understand a VPC

* In VPC there are 3 different IP ranges reserved for private IPs only as mentioned below: `Use cidr.xyz for better understanding`  
  * 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) `Commonly used among corporate N/W`  
  * 172.16.0.0 - 10.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)  
  * 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)  
* Features:  
  * Launch instances into a subnet of your choice.  
  * Assign custom IP ranges in each subnet.  
  * Configure route tables between subnets.  
  * Create Internet GW & attach to our VPC.
  * Better security control over AWS resouces.  
  * Instance security groups.  
  * Subnet Network ACLs.  
* When dealing with default VPC you can consider below mentioned points: 
  | Default VPC  |  
  |--------------|  
  | User friendly, allowing you to deploy instances immediately.  |  
  | All subnets have route out to public internet.  |  
  | Each EC2 instance has both public & private IP  |  
* VPC Peering 
  * Allows you to connect one VPC another VPC via a direct network route using private IP.  
  * Instances behaves as they are in same private network.  
  * We can peer VPCs with other AWS accounts, as well as with other VPCs in tohe same account.  
  * Peering works in star topology configuraiton, which means 1 VPC peers with the other 4 VPCs.  
  * You can peer VPC between regions as well.
